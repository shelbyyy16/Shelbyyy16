# Hi, I'm Shelby. Welcome to my corner of the internet.

## About Me

I am a Critical Care Nurse turned Fullstack Software Engineer. I am currently also learning Graphic Design so I can increase the quality and visual appeal of my front-end web applications.
In my (very limited) free time I am passionate about reading, trying new recipes and trying to keep my house plants alive.ðŸŒ±
