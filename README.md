# Hi, I'm Shelby. Welcome to my corner of the internet! 

## About Me

I am a Critical Care Nurse turned Fullstack Software Engineer. I am currently also learning Graphic Design so I can increase the quality and visual appeal of my front-end web applications.
In my (very limited) free time I am passionate about reading, trying new recipes and trying to keep my house plants alive.ðŸŒ± 

## Projects

- [Cart Quest](https://github.com/shelbyyy16/Project-1): Cart Quest is a memory game where you must remember and repeat a sequence of grocery items. It keeps track of your wins and losses and offers increasingly challenging levels as you progress through the game. Messages are displayed to guide you, and buttons appear and disappear to control your interactions.

- [Portfolio](https://github.com/shelbyyy16/react-portfolio): This portfolio was built using React to showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a Software Engineer.
